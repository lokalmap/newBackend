# loopback-angular2-auth-demo
This is a simple practice project build using [LoopBack.io](http://loopback.io) and [Angular2](https://angular.io/).

- The main codebase is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).
- The frontend (angular2) codebase (i.e., under `/client` folder) is generated by [`angular-cli`](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

### If you are looking to start an Angular2 + Loopback project, then use the `init`
